         <br>Girl you don't know, nah<br>
        <br>What you do to me<br>
        <br>When I see that crinkle on your nose<br>
        <br>I wonder if you fluently just<br>
        <br>Do you<br>
        <br>Like you do so effortlessly<br>
        <br>I want you right next to me<br>
        <br>I want you to be my<br>
        <br>Be my, my<br>
        <br><br>
        <br>Green Tea in the morning<br>
        <br>Be my, my sugar honey<br>
        <br>You're just so great<br>
        <br>I wonder girl<br>
        <br>I wonder why you love me<br>
        <br>It's so lovely, can't complain<br>
        <br>One day I'll give you my name<br>
        <br>If you're down<br>
        <br>If you're down<br>
        <br><br>
        <br>Be my Green Tea in the morning<br>
        <br>Be my, my sugar honey<br>
        <br>You're just so great<br>
        <br>I wonder girl<br>
        <br>I wonder why you love me<br>
        <br>It's so lovely, can't complain<br>
        <br>One day I'll give you my name<br>
        <br>If you're down<br>
        <br>If you're down<br>
        <br><br>
        <br>I can't describe the feeling you gave<br>
        <br>When you blew me away<br>
        <br>And I<br>
        <br>Carry that every day<br>
        <br>My sunshine and my moon<br>
        <br>You're all I wanna do<br>
        <br>Every night until we're through<br>
        <br>These little moments that we've got<br>
        <br>(That we've got)<br>
        <br><br>
        <br>You make me feel like something I'm not<br>
        <br>Green Tea and Honey babe<br>
        <br>So warm and sweet<br>
        <br>You're all I need<br>
        <br>Just you and me<br>
        <br>I said now here we go again<br>
        <br>Another verse about<br>
        <br>How you got me feeling it<br>
        <br>I'm feeling very many different<br>
        <br>Types of ways<br>
        <br>I just gotta say<br>
        <br>I just wanna see you<br>
        <br>Every second of every day<br>
        <br>If that's ok then let me know<br>
        <br>Yes I got the flow<br>
        <br>That can make us go afloat<br>
        <br><br>
        <br>Thirty thousand we won't ever hear below<br>
        <br>You're a queen and<br>
        <br>The world is yours, a whole (yeah)<br>
        <br>Baby I got you and<br>
        <br>Baby you got me<br>
        <br>Tell me how you feelin'<br>
        <br>Just keep it real and<br>
        <br>Promise we'll find peace<br>
        <br>Your smile it got me<br>
        <br>Got me lost like your eyes<br>
        <br>Baby I just want you<br>
